The **Door Knock Route Optimizer** is a Python-based tool that helps real estate professionals and sales agents optimize their door-knocking routes. The system processes a list of addresses and generates an efficient path while **avoiding cemeteries and railway areas**, ensuring time and effort are spent in high-potential neighborhoods.
